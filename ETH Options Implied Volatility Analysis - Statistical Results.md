### Cross-Asset Correlation Signals
- **Crypto-TradFi Divergence**: Strong divergence (3.7x VIX ratio)
- **ETH-BTC Divergence**: ETH showing 2x BTC realized volatility
- **Regime Stability**: Low VIX suggests stable macro environment

## Risk Assessment

### Model Limitations
1. **Historical Data Constraints**: Limited crypto options history vs traditional markets
2. **Regime Dependency**: Crypto volatility patterns may not follow traditional models
3. **Liquidity Considerations**: ETH options market still developing vs equity options
4. **Correlation Assumptions**: Cross-asset relationships may be unstable

- **Regime Persistence**: Medium confidence in current regime classification

## Trading Strategy Implications

### Relative Value Assessment
- **IV Level**: MODERATELY EXPENSIVE (65th percentile)
- **VRP**: POSITIVE but not extreme (6.4%)
- **Skew**: ELEVATED put protection premium (13% skew)

### Optimal Strategies
1. **Volatility Selling**: Moderate opportunity given positive VRP
2. **Skew Trading**: Elevated put skew suggests put selling opportunities

4. **Cross-Asset**: ETH vol premium vs traditional markets creates relative value

### Risk Management
- **Maximum Adverse Scenario**: IV could reach 73.1% (95th percentile)
- **Liquidity Risk**: Monitor ETH options market depth
